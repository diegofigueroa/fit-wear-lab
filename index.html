<p>As you may already know, wearable devices have arrived. We are right now being witnesses of a new era on personal computing. We are about to enter a world where we'll connected 24/7. This can be truly awesome, but can also be terryble. Being connected all the time means having to deal with a lot of information constantly, this can be very distracting, and even frustrating.</p>

<p>This is where wearables should be the hero, a wearable device must only be noticed when needed, and passed unnoticed the rest of the time.</p>

<p>This means you are at the right time to start making cool stuff with wearables, hopefully this code lab will be just the kickstart you have been waiting for.</p>

<p>As you already know, Android Wear is the newest platform for wearable devices from Google. It leverages on the power of the Android platform you already know. And therefore provides great compatibility with existing Android applications you have already built. </p>

<h4>
<a name="notifications" class="anchor" href="#notifications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notifications</h4>

<p>If your Android app uses Notifications, then chances are these notifications will show up on an Android Wear compatible device with no extra work. How awesome is that?</p>

<p>But, you can make a little work and improve the experience significatively. We will work on this today.</p>

<h3>
<a name="getting-started" class="anchor" href="#getting-started"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Getting Started</h3>

<p>Let's get started by downloading the code lab base code, you can find links for doing this on the right side of the page. Or just follow this <a href="https://github.com/diegofigueroa/fit-wear-lab/archive/master.zip">link</a></p>

<h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Designer Templates</h3>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Rather Drive Stick?</h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<h3>
<a name="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
