{"name":"Wear 101","tagline":"Android wear codelab for FIT 2014","body":"## Welcome\r\nAs you may already know, wearable devices have arrived. We are right now being witnesses of a new era on personal computing. We are about to enter a world where we'll connected 24/7. This can be truly awesome, but can also be terryble. Being connected all the time means having to deal with a lot of information constantly, this can be very distracting, and even frustrating.\r\n\r\nThis is where wearables should be the hero, a wearable device must only be noticed when needed, and passed unnoticed the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nThis means you are at the right time to start making cool stuff with wearables, hopefully this codelab will be just the kickstart you have been waiting for.\r\n\r\nAs you already know, Android Wear is the newest platform for wearable devices from Google. It leverages on the power of the Android platform you already know. And therefore provides great compatibility with existing Android applications you have already built. \r\n\r\nIf your Android app uses Notifications, then chances are these notifications will show up on an Android Wear compatible device with no extra work. How awesome is that?\r\n\r\nBut, you can make a little work and improve the experience significatively. We will work on this today.\r\n\r\n### Getting the source\r\n\r\nLet's get started by downloading the codelab base code, you can find links for doing this on the right side of the page. Or just follow this [link](https://github.com/diegofigueroa/fit-wear-lab/archive/master.zip)\r\n\r\n### Steps\r\n\r\nThe codelab is split into the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Getting started\r\n2. Set up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) for Wear\r\n3. Showing my first notification on Wear\r\n4. Extending notifications for Wear\r\n5. Done!\r\n\r\nLet's get started! Scroll down to see your first step.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nSet up the Android Studio project and explore the sample app.\r\n\r\n1. [Welcome!](#welcome!)\r\n2.
